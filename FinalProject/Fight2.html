	<p> So, you really accept the dudes hot chocolate made from his mom and then not forgive him. Not cool. But back to the story, Gus and Derek fight and they both throw some good combos. Derek tries to hit Gus with a 1,2 but Gus moves out of the way from them and lands a punch to the body then to the head and back to the body. The fight goes on like that for another 10 minutes. Where do they think they are? The UFC? BORING!!!! So Ill intervene. I shout to them “Use your powers” from above. They look very confused to who said that because I’m not physically there but whatever, Gus uses his powers when Derek has his guard dropped and BOOM the house is on fire. But what’s this? Lucy is DEAD!! Gus kills her instead of killing Derek who is almost dead. What will you do now??</p>
