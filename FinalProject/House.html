    <p>You did it you made your first choice. I know you only had one option, but the other option was to shut off your computer and never see this awful story again so thank you. So back to the story…. Gus makes it inside Derek’s moms house whose name is Lucy (I just remembered. I know she told me before, but I am really bad with names). Derek obviously is on his way to rescue his mom cause duh. And Gus is ready to kill him.</p>
        <br>
    <p>When Derek enters, he sees Gus holding his mom in a hostage and threatening way. Derek pleads to Gus to “Let her GO!!!!!” But Gus all angry shouts “this is revenge for killing my wife.” Derek tries remembers when he ever killed someone’s wife, but he can’t. Derek makes a I don’t know what you’re talking about face. Gus impatiently throws a little fire ball at Derek and helps him remember “That day you fought my neighbor and destroyed the entire block.” Derek makes that oh I remember face and says “ohhh I remember…. But please let my mom go and let me explain what happened.” “NO” shouts Glen. “Please I will explain everything and if you let my mom go, she could make us some hot chocolate” says Derek. </p>
