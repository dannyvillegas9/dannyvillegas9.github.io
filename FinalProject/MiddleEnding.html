	<p> Congratulations you have made it to the CRAZY ENDING!!! While trying to kill Derek you actually made Gus kill him mom instead. Gus feels very guilty, so he backs off and runs away. This is not what he planned to happen at all, but it did. Congrats again for trying to get revenge but wimping out when it went too far. </p>
