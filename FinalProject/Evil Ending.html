Congratulations! You have made it to the EVIL ENDING!!! Your mom must be so proud. Gus has gotten his revenge by avenging his wife by killing Derek, but Gus also killed a sweet and innocent lady. And NO Lucy was just a way to get to Derek, she was never meant to get hurt. And when she did you just decided to kill the entire family tree by killing Derek too when he was in deep emotional pain. You know Gus has to live with these choices youâ€™ve made him go through for the rest of his life. Yes, I know Gus was filled with revenge, but you really took it too far and you refused hot chocolate. I honestly cant believe it. Hot chocolate fixes everything. But congrats again, I guess.
