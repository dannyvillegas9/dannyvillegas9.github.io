Congratulations you have made it to the GOOD ENDING!!! Gus did not avenge his wife but that is entirely cool. You decided to accept Derek’s apology and drink hot chocolate. Gus and Derek are now best friends can you believe that. I’m kidding they’re not. They don’t have anything in common. Either way it has been a good day for everyone. Congratulations again and remember to make some other good choices in your life today. </p>
