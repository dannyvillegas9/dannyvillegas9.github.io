<h1>Listen To Derek</h1>
    <h2>Accept or Decline?</h2>

	<p> 
Good for you for accepting hot chocolate and to listen to Derek. Well Derek doesn’t really have an excuse for fighting Gus’s neighbor and killing his wife, but Derek really wants forgiveness. Will you give it to him? On one side forgiveness is the best option because revenge is a fool’s game and the hot chocolate is sooooo good but on the other Derek didn’t even say sorry yet. Its up to you.
