    <h1>World of Gus</h1>

      <h2> Factory Explosion</h2>

    <p>So, a factory exploded and covered the entire city in smoke. Crazy smoke that was. It gave people superhuman powers. Can you believe that? Actual POWERS. It was like a miracle sent from above. But there’s others who believe it was sent from below. Well just one guy. And this is this one guys revenge story…. or not. It depends on you really. What choices will you make?</p>
      <h2>Meta vs Meta vs _____ </h2>

    <p>So, let’s cut to the chase. A dude named Derek fights another dude and guess what. They both have powers! Isn’t that crazy. What exactly went wrong you asked? Well the short answer is everything. Derek and the other dude destroyed an entire block because they couldn’t control their powers and they’re idiots. They killed the wife of the guy whose choices you’ll be clicking on. </p>
     <H2> Who am I?</H2>

      <p> Congrats you’ve actually made it this far; I didn’t think you actually knew how to read. But back to the story: You’re controlling Gus’s life.  Gus has powers too, big shocker. He has fire powers obviously (bet you’re looking at the image above). But Gus is MAD. Like extremely mad. Like he is going to find the address to Derek’s moms house to threaten her and lure Derek to the house to kill him mad. </p>
